# wvubeamer
This repository provides a beamer theme based on the WVU Statler College Powerpoint Presentation theme

You can use it as you would any normal (poorly done beamer template).

If you are not familar with beamer then you can look at the example file to see how things work.

You can use this however you want, but it comes with no warranty or anything like that.

This readme needs a lot of work.
